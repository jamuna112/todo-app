Creating a todo-app:

Plan: 
    - List of menu:
        * Add
        * Update
        * Search
        * List
        * Delete
    - Menu will be in loop, asking user if they want to continue
    - create a package for all the functionality
        * AddTask(task []Tasks)
        * UpdateTask(task []Tasks)
        * SearchTask(task []Tasks)
        * ListAllTask(task []Tasks)
        * DeleteATask(task []Tasks, id int)
        * ReadFile 
        * WriteInJsonFile


- Current issue encounter in program:
    * once I deleted the task, and try to add new task all the previous tasks were added back to the ReadFile
    * task id increament is not increamenting properly.
